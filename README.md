# AI Flappy Bird with NEAT

An implementation of Flappy Bird with artificial intelligence using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm.

## Overview

This project aims to create an AI-powered Flappy Bird game where birds are controlled by a neural network evolved through the NEAT algorithm. The birds learn to navigate through pipes by evolving their neural networks over generations.

## Features

- Flappy Bird game with AI-controlled birds.
- NEAT algorithm for evolving neural networks.
- Visual representation of the evolving bird population.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Frankie0411/AI-Flappy-Bird.git
   ```

2. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
